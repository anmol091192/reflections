When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
So that other can alsoo contribute to the project and it also serves as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because the git doesnot know when the changes being made are completed or not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are similar to clones but the original respository is not effected of the changes made in the cloned respository.
Clones are copy of original respository and the changes are updated in both the original as well as the cloned repository.
Branches are commits made on the repository .

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so that we can compare if changes are made remotely.
