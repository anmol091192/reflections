How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It saved so much of my time and i was easily able to identify the difference between the old version and the new one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You could always go to older versions of your code if the newer version had some problems
and compare to what went wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros - you can save only when u do a major logical change and not to save for every single change.

Cons - Sometimes you may forget to save the changes after doing a logical change which may cause problems.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
